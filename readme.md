# GitIgnoreParser

GitIgnoreParser is an advanced Kotlin library designed to parse `.gitignore` files and determine file exclusions based
on gitignore specifications with efficiency and precision. This tool is particularly useful for developers looking to
programmatically apply `.gitignore` rules in their Kotlin-based projects.

## Features

- **Kotlin-Friendly**: Designed with Kotlin's modern language features in mind for a seamless integration.
- **Efficient Parsing**: Converts `.gitignore` glob patterns to regex for precise and fast matching.
- **Nested `.gitignore` Support**: Handles `.gitignore` files in subdirectories, ensuring comprehensive rule
  application.
- **Directory Specific Rules**: Accurately applies rules specific to directories, adhering to `.gitignore` standards.
- **Optimized for Large Projects**: Ideal for use in large-scale projects with extensive file structures, ensuring
  performance.
- **Advanced Logging**: Integrates sophisticated logging mechanisms for enhanced debugging and operational tracking.

## Installation

### Using JitPack

Add the JitPack repository to your build file:

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```

Add the dependency:

```gradle
dependencies {
   implementation 'com.github.YourUsername:GitIgnoreParser:Tag'
}
```

## Usage

The GitIgnoreParser library is seamlessly integrable into your Kotlin projects. Here‚Äôs how to use it:

1. **Initialize the Parser**: Create an instance of `GitIgnoreParser` by passing the path to your `.gitignore` file.

    ```kotlin
    val gitIgnoreFilePath = "/path/to/your/.gitignore"
    val parser = GitIgnoreParser(gitIgnoreFilePath)
    ```

2. **Check File Exclusion**: To determine if a specific file is excluded by the `.gitignore` rules, use
   the `isExcludedByGitignore` method. Provide the relative path of the file to this method.

    ```kotlin
    val relativeFilePath = "src/main/Example.kt"
    val isExcluded = parser.isExcludedByGitignore(relativeFilePath)
    println("Is the file excluded: $isExcluded")
    ```

3. **Get Exclusion Pattern**: To find out which specific `.gitignore` pattern is causing a file to be excluded, use
   the `isExcludedByGitignoreWithPattern` method. This returns the matching pattern, if any.

    ```kotlin
    val exclusionPattern = parser.isExcludedByGitignoreWithPattern(relativeFilePath)
    exclusionPattern?.let {
        println("Excluded by pattern: $it")
    } ?: println("File is not excluded.")
    ```

4. **Process Files in a Directory**: To process all files in a directory, utilize the `FileProcessor` class. It helps in
   traversing the directory, checking each file against the `.gitignore` rules, and compiling a list of included files.

    ```kotlin
    val projectRoot = Paths.get("/path/to/your/project")
    val fileProcessor = FileProcessor(projectRoot, parser)
    val includedFiles = fileProcessor.processFiles()
    ```

5. **Print Summary**: You can print a summary of the operation after processing the files, including the total files
   processed, files included, and patterns used.

    ```kotlin
    fileProcessor.printSummary()
    ```

This Kotlin adaptation of the library offers a modern and concise approach, enhancing the user experience in
Kotlin-based projects.

## Sample Console Output

To give you a better idea of how the GitIgnoreParser works in practice, here is a sample of the console output you can
expect. This output demonstrates the library's process of evaluating files against `.gitignore` rules and provides
insights into its operation.

### Sample Log:

This log shows the detailed process of how the GitIgnoreParser assesses each file, including any `.gitignore` patterns
that apply, and the final decision on whether each file is ignored or included.

Note: The actual output may vary based on your project's `.gitignore` file and the specific files being processed.
